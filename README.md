A Google dork query, sometimes just referred to as a dork, is a search string or custom query that uses advanced search operators to find information not readily available on a website.

Google dorking, also known as Google hacking, can return information difficult to locate through simple search queries. This includes information not intended for public viewing, but that is inadequately protected and can, therefore, be "dorked" by a hacker.

How Google dorking works
Google dorking is a passive attack or hacking method involving the use of a custom query. Hackers use Google to identify websites with security vulnerabilities and/or sensitive information the attacker can use, usually for some malicious purpose.

Around since 2002, dorking usually involves using a search engine as a hacking tool. Google's tremendous web crawling capabilities facilitate dorking. With a Google dork, attackers can access a lot of information they wouldn't be able to get with simple queries. This information includes the following:


usernames and passwords

email address lists

sensitive documents

personally identifiable information

personally identifiable financial information

website vulnerabilities

More often than not, this information is used for many types of illegal activities, including cybercrime, cyberterrorism, industrial espionage, identity theft and cyberstalking. Hackers may also sell this data to other criminals on the dark web for large sums of money
